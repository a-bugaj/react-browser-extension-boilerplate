# React browser extension boilerplate
Create your own browser extension using React!


## How to setup
Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-bugaj/react-browser-extension-boilerplate.git
```

Install dependencies
```shell
yarn install or npm install
```

Run in dev mode
```shell
yarn start:dev or npm run start:dev
```

At this point, webpack should generate a dist folder and update it with every change.

- Open your  browser (for example chrome), and go to `chrome://extensions/` and turn on developer mode <br/>

- After visiting any page, you should see content rendered from ExtensionContent.tsx file <br />
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Webpack detect any changes and generate new dist folder but on your side is (unfortunately) reloading of the web extension in the browser.
